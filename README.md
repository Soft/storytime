# Storytime

Storytime is a choice-based interactive fiction system. It features a simple
plain-text format for writing stories and has a slick browser-based interface
for playing them out. Building more complex narratives is also supported through
the use of conditions and actions.

## Installation

Storytime is implemented in Haskell and currently the easiest way to install it
is using Cabal packaging tool.

~~~bash
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/Soft/storytime
cd storytime
cabal install --only-dependencies
cabal build
cabal install --user
~~~

## Usage

Storytime has a support for multiple different interfaces for viewing content.
Currently, a web-based viewer and a simple terminal-based viewer are included.

~~~bash
storytime [-V|--validate] [-i|--interface INTERFACE] FILE
~~~

For example, the web-based viewer can be launched by simply running the command:

~~~bash
storytime adventure.story
~~~

Running the command automatically opens the web browser pointing at the viewer
playing out story from file `adventure.story`.

The `--validate` switch instructs Storytime to perform some simple diagnostics
on the story file and exit.

## Language

### Sections and Links

Sections are the backbone of Storytime documents and every piece of fiction must
have at least one of them. One can define a new section by starting the line
with an asterisk and following it with section's name. Section names have to
begin with a letter and can contain alphanumeric characters, hyphen (-) and
forward slash (/).

~~~
* beginning

Once in a far away land...

[castle]: Explore the castle
[invest]: Become a fairly successful middle manager at a mid-sized investment bank

* castle

You gaze upon the steep walls of the fortress. Climbing them would certainly be
a hurdle.

* invest

On a whim, you decide to look for lucrative investment opportunities in the
derivatives market.

~~~

Links connect the sections together and make the story come to live. Links have
to be listed after the content of a section. In the most basic form, a link
consists of a target and a title.

### Variables and Conditions

It is sometimes useful to have conditional links between sections. Conditional
link is only visible if a specified condition is met. Conditions are simple
boolean expressions. Here are a few examples of valid conditions:
`numberOfDragons > 900`, `a = b && b > 10`, `~(a = 1) || (a = 1)`. One can
add a condition to a link by following the target with a bar (|) and the
condition. For example:

~~~

* example

[another | a > 5]: This link is only visible if 'a' is greater than five.
[another | ~(a > 5) ]: This link is only visible if 'a' is not greater than five.

* another

Hurrah!

~~~

Links can also modify variables. The modifications only take place if the link
is followed. If the player can use the link multiple times (for example, if the
sections form loops), the modifications are executed every time. One can add
multiple actions to a single link by separating them with a comma, the actions
will be executed from left to right. 

~~~
* engaging-section

Loop!

[engaging-section | a < 9, +a]: This link leads to the same section and increments 'a' by one every time it is followed. The link will disappear after 'a' becomes greater than ten.
[end| a > 8]: Forward

* end

...that was quite enough

~~~

Actions can contain simple integer expressions. For example, the following are
all valid actions `a = a + 10`, `+power`, `-enemies`, `price = (a * b + c) - d`

Here's another example:

~~~
* first

Some text...

[second, rubber-chicken = 1, points = points + 50]: Take the rubber chicken

* second

~~~

### Conditional Content

Sections can also include conditional content. Example bellow demonstrates this:

~~~
* section

What a fate! To be lost in an infinite maze of cubicles.
${rubber-chicken>0: Luckily you have your trusted rubber chicken with
you.}${~(rubber-chicken>0): To make matters worse, you left your rubber chicken
at home.}

~~~

### Section Actions

Sections can also have actions associated with them. The actions are executed
every time player views the sections.

~~~
* example, +turn, price = price * 2

...
~~~

### Miscellanea

Storytime documents can start with a metadata block. How the metadata will be
used depends on the selected viewer.

~~~
% title: A Witty Title
% author: John Doe

* first-section

...
~~~

## Examples

The embedded scripting language can be used to do all kinds of things that might
not be immediately useful for writing interactive fiction. For example, one
might make a story that calculates the Fibonacci sequence:

~~~
* init, a = 1, b = 2, num = (a + b)

${a}, ${b}...

[fib]: Reticulate splines

* fib

${num}

[fib, a = b, b = num, num = (a + b)]: Fibonacci!
~~~

The examples folder in the repository contains few example stories.

## Bugs

Storytime is still at the experimental stage of development and bugs are bound
to occur from time to time. Bug reporst can be filled at the
[issue tracker hosted at BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/Soft/storytime/issues).
